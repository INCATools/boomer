# Trivial examples

Ontologies A and B both have 4 classes that are singletons/unconnected.

This example just serves to highlight the most basic case where the
most likely interpretation of each connection is selected, and there
are no complicating factors.

```
A:1 ProperSubClassOf B:1        (most probable) 0.7
A:2 ProperSuperClassOf B:2      (most probable) 0.7
A:3 EquivalentTo B:3    (most probable) 0.7
A:4 SiblingOf B:4       (most probable) 0.7
```
